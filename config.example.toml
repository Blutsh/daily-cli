# daily configuration example
# Copy this file to ~/.daily/config.toml

# Directory where daily notes are stored
# You can use ~ for user's home directory
# Default: ~/.daily/dailies
dailies_dir = "~/.daily/dailies"

# Alternative: use a custom path
# dailies_dir = "~/Documents/dailies"
# dailies_dir = "/home/user/Obsidian/dailies"
